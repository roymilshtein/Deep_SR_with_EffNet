# Deep Learning - Speaker Recognition with EfficientNet Using MelSpectrograms
This repository explores the application of EfficientNet, a CNN architecture, for speaker identification tasks.
By converting audio data into Mel-Spectrograms, the study assesses the efficacy of EfficientNet models in improving accuracy and computational efficiency.

The repository includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with detailed experiments comparing different EfficientNet scales.
The goal is to advance speaker identification methods by leveraging EfficientNet's strengths in handling complex audio data in an efficient matter.

## The Git folder contains:

**Written article - Speaker Recognition with EfficientNet using MelSpectrograms.pdf** - summarizing the methods, experiments and results of the project.

**EfficientNet_Speaker_Identification_Train.ipynb** – notebook with full training code. Shows
the training on the final b2 net. The code is split into blocks and contains many comments explaining
its functions.

**Audio2img.ipynb notebook** – compiles methods of converting audio to an image.
Contains visualizations for a sample.

**Saved_weights** – folder with the best trained weights for models: b0, b1, b2.

**LibriSpeech** – dataset folder with smaller sets not used in the final project. The full dataset used is
the train-clean-360 that has 30GB and is too big for the drive.

The code was trained on a PC with windows, and not on Google Colab, therefore adaptations must be
made to file paths in order to run. The dataset is very large so running on Colab was not a viable
option.

In order to test the saved weights, run all the blocks, except for the training block. This will define the
models, load the data, load the saved weights, and finally evaluate the model on the test set.
